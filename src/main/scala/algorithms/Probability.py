# p(a or b) = p(a) + p(b) - p(a and b)
# p(a and b) = 0 if a and b are disjoint
#p(a|b) = p(a and b) / p(b) = p(a) * p(b|a) / p(b)
#E(x) = p(x)*x
#e(x1+x2) = e(x1) + e(x2)
#uniform distribution e[x] = (a+b) / 2
#binomial dist e[x] = p(X =x) = p^x*(1-p)^(n-x)*(n choose x) where x is number of succ attempts
# e[x] = p * n
#geometric dist P(X=x) = (1-p)^(x-1) * p. x is number of attempts for succ one happens
#e[x] = 1/p
